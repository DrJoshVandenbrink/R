267376_at	oligonucleotide	Arabidopsis thaliana	no	AT2G26330	Homologous to receptor protein kinases. Involved in specification of organs originating from the shoot apical meristem. Contains a cytoplasmic protein kinase catalytic domain, a transmembrane region, and an extracellular leucine-rich repeat.  ER has been identified as a quantitative trait locus for transpiration efficiency by influencing epidermal and mesophyll development, stomatal density and porosity of leaves. It has been implicated in resistance to the bacterium Ralstonia solanacearum and to the necrotrophic fungus Plectosphaerella cucumerina.  Together with ERL1 and ERL2, ER governs the initial decision of protodermal cells to either divide proliferatively to produce pavement cells or divide asymmetrically to generate stomatal complexes. ER binds to the peptides STOMAGEN and EPF2 which compete for the same binding site. The ER-EFP2 complex activates MAPK signaling that inhibits stomatal development. ER-STOMAGEN does not activate MAPK signaling. Plants harboring loss of function alleles of er are more susceptible to heat stress than wild type.  In Arabidopsis and other organisms, overexpression of ER confers thermotolerance via as yet undefined mechanisms.	2

263949_at	oligonucleotide	Arabidopsis thaliana	no	AT2G36060	MMZ3/UEV1C encodes a protein that may play a role in DNA damage responses and error-free post-replicative DNA repair by participating in lysine-63-based polyubiquitination reactions. UEV1C can form diubiquitin and triubiquitin chains in combination with UBC13A/UBC35 in vitro. It can also functionally complement an mms2 mutation in budding yeast, both by increasing mms2 mutant viability in the presence of the DNA damaging agent MMS, and by reducing the rate of spontaneous DNA mutation. It can also rescue an mms2 ubc13 double mutant in yeast in combination with UBC13A. MMZ3/UEV1C transcripts are found at moderate levels in most plant organs, but cannot be detected in the pollen or 2 days after germination. Transcript levels do not appear to be stress-inducible.	2

UEV1A can form diubiquitin and triubiquitin chains in combination with UBC13A/UBC35 in vitro. It can also functionally complement an mms2 mutation in budding yeast, both by increasing mms2 mutant viability in the presence of the DNA damaging agent MMS, and by reducing the rate of spontaneous DNA mutation. However, a combination of MMZ1/UEV1A and UBC13A do not do a good job of rescuing an mms2 ubc13 double mutant in yeast. MMZ1/UEV1A transcripts are found at low levels in most plant organs, but cannot be detected in the pollen. Transcript levels do not appear to be stress-inducible. The uev1a-1 mutant shows normal sensitivity to MMS in germination assays suggesting that UEV1A is not required for DNA damage tolerance during this developmental stage.	1

251429_at	oligonucleotide	Arabidopsis thaliana	no	AT3G60190	At3g60190 encodes Arabidopsis dynamin-related protein 1E, DRP1E, also known as EDR3, ADL4 and ADL1E, which is 624 amino acid residues long, has a predicted mass of 69.8 kDa and a pI of 7.5.  Dynamin-related protein 1E belongs to a plant-specific subclass of dynamin-related proteins (DRP1), consisting of five members in Arabidopsis (A, B, C, D, E). This class is characterized by having an N-terminal GTPase domain, a central `dynamin 2` domain and a C-terminal GTPase effector domain (GED), a typical structure for plant dynamin-related proteins. However, this class lacks a PH domain and a proline-rich domain, which are found in classical animal dynamin-like proteins. Based on work on animal dynamins, the plant DRP1 proteins should be able to form polymeric structures that wrap around membranes to facilitate membrane tubulation and pinching off of vesicles, processes that are essential to vesicle trafficking and membrane compartmentalization.  The edr3 mutation causes a P77L substitution in the G2 motif of the GTPase domain of DRP1E.  edr3 mutant Arabidopsis plants display enhanced cell death in response to powdery mildew infection.	3

Genetic analyses suggest that this gene is involved in multiple flowering pathways. Mutations in PIE1 results in suppression of FLC-mediated delay of flowering and causes early flowering in noninductive photoperiods independently of FLC. PIE1 is required for expression of FLC in the shoot apex but not in the root.Along with ARP6 forms a complex to deposit modified histone H2A.Z at several loci within the genome. This modification alters the expression of the target genes (i.e. FLC, MAF4, MAF6). The mRNA is cell-to-cell mobile.	3

CEP1 was also released to the tapetal cell wall during late stage 6 and stage 7. After the tapetal cell wall degenerated, the CEP1 enzyme entered the callose wall from the degenerated tapetal cell wall and was probably involved in degeneration of the callose wall.	5

But, MAGO-Y14-PYM ternary complexes are difficult to detect in vivo in Arabidopsis based on pull-down experiments. However there is some evidence for a weak association in Arabidopsis flowers. PYM appears primarily cytoplasmic, but it also seems to into the nucleus at times. Its nuclear localization signal has not been rigorously defined, but there is evidence for a nuclear export signal between amino acids 171-205 in the C-terminus.	1

CDPKs contain an intrinsic Ca2+-activation domain with four EF hand Ca2+-binding sites.  CDPKs protein kinases have been proposed to function in multiple plant signal transduction pathways downstream of [Ca2+]cyt elevations, thus transducing various physiological responses.  CPK6 is expressed in both guard cells and mesophyll cells.  Functions in guard cell ion channel regulation.   ABA and Ca(2+) activation of slow-type anion channels and, interestingly, ABA activation of plasma membrane Ca(2+)-permeable channels were impaired in independent alleles of single and double cpk3cpk6 mutant guard cells.  Furthermore, ABA- and Ca(2+)-induced stomatal closing were partially impaired in these cpk3cpk6 mutant alleles.  The protein kinase CPK6 is shown in biochemical assays to be directly activated by elevations in calcium concentrations in the physiological range (Laanements et al., 2013 PlantPhys.; PMID: 23766366). These data correlate with the in vivo function of CPK6 in Ca2+ and ABA activation of S-type anion channels (Mori et al., 2006 PLoS Biol.;  PMID: 17032064) and the ability of CPK6 to mediate ABA activation of SLAC1 (Brandt et al., 2012 PNAS; PMID: 22689970).The mRNA is cell-to-cell mobile.	2

UEV1A can form diubiquitin and triubiquitin chains in combination with UBC13A/UBC35 in vitro. It can also functionally complement an mms2 mutation in budding yeast, both by increasing mms2 mutant viability in the presence of the DNA damaging agent MMS, and by reducing the rate of spontaneous DNA mutation. However, a combination of MMZ2/UEV1B and UBC13A do not do a good job of rescuing an mms2 ubc13 double mutant in yeast. MMZ2/UEV1B transcripts are found in most plant organs, but not in the pollen or in seedlings 6 hours or 2 days post-germination. The transcript levels do not appear to be stress-inducible. The mRNA is cell-to-cell mobile.	1

The lower net NH4+ influx across the vacuolar membrane and relatively alkaline cytosolic pH of root hairs in cap1-1 relative to wild type implied that mutation of CAP1 results in more NH4+ accumulation in the cytoplasm. Furthermore, CAP1 functionally complemented npr1 kinase yeast mutant defective in high-affinity NH4+ uptake via MEP2, distinguishing CAP1 as a cytosolic modulator of NH4+ level that participates in NH4+ homeostasis-regulated root hair growth by modulating tip-focused cytoplasmic Ca2+ gradients.	5

The protein was determined to have peroxidase activity. This activity is thought to be dependent on the presence of post-translational modifications (most likely phosphorylation). The protein was shown to be present as a mixture of monomer and homodimer. The homodimerization seems to be dependent on the presence of Ca2+ or H2O2. The dimerization was prevented by the addition of DTT, &#946;-mercaptoethanol and TCEP. Annat1 mRNA is expressed in flowers, roots,leaves and stems and is most abundant in stems. mRNA levels are increased in response to oxidative stress.  Developmental expression patterns suggest a role in Golgi-mediated polysaccharide secretion. It is a Ca  2+-permeable transporter providing a molecular link between reactive oxygen species and cytosolic Ca 2+ in plants. The mRNA is cell-to-cell mobile.	1

The ARC5 gene product shares similarity with the dynamin family of GTPases, which mediate endocytosis, mitochondrial division, and other organellar fission and fusion events in eukaryotes. Phylogenetic analysis showed that ARC5 is related to a group of dynamin-like proteins unique to plants. A GFP-ARC5 fusion protein localizes to a ring at the chloroplast division site. Chloroplast import and protease protection assays indicate that the ARC5 ring is positioned on the outer surface of the chloroplast. Facilitates separation of the two daughter chloroplasts.	3

258590_at	oligonucleotide	Arabidopsis thaliana	no	AT3G04280	Encodes an atypical subtype of the ARR (Arabidopsis response regulator) protein family. ARR22 is more similar to the receiver domains of hybrid kinases than other response regulators. It acts as a phosphohistidine phosphatase when tested with phospho-AHP5 in vitro suggesting that it might be involved in a two-component phosphorelay. Expression of ARR22 transcripts appears to be localized to the chalaza and to be induced by wounding. Ectopic expression of ARR in other parts of the plant leads to reduced cytokinin-related responses and impaired root, shoot, and flower development. Overexpression of wild-type ARR22 in an arr22 mutant background causes variable defects in plant growth and fertility. But, in the same ar22 background, over-expression of versions of ARR22 that should act as dominant-negative or constitutively active proteins, based on mutations to the conserved Asp residue, do not show any phenotypic abnormalities, raising the possibility that these may not act as canonical response regulators.	3

248010_at	oligonucleotide	Arabidopsis thaliana	no	AT5G56290	Encodes the peroxisomal targeting signal type 1 receptor that facilitates peroxisomal protein translocation. It recognizes proteins with the PTS1 consensus sequence (tripeptide SKL or a conserved variant) at the extreme C terminus.  The protein has several domains, including C-terminal tetratricopeptide repeat motifs which act in binding the C-terminal "SKL" targeting signal.  The mechanism of transport has been worked out in other organisms:  The receptor recognizes and binds cytosolic PTS1-containing proteins.  The PEX5-PTS1 complex binds a PEX14/PEX13 receptor complex at the peroxisome membrane and is translocated into the peroxisome matrix in a process dependent on PEX2,PEX10, and PEX12.  In the peroxisome matrix, PEX5 releases its cargo and is recycled to the cytosol in a process dependent on PEX1, PEX4, PEX6 and PEX22.  It is also involved, in conjunction with PEX7, in PTS1- and PTS2-dependent peroxisomal protein import.  RNAi experiments suggest that PEX5 is necessary for the maintenance of both glyoxysomal and leaf peroxisomal functions.	5

260483_at	oligonucleotide	Arabidopsis thaliana	no	AT1G11000	A member of a large family of seven-transmembrane domain proteins specific to plants, homologs of the barley mildew resistance locus o (MLO) protein. The Arabidopsis genome contains 15 genes encoding MLO proteins, with localization in plasma membrane. Phylogenetic analysis revealed four clades of closely-related AtMLO genes. ATMLO4 belongs to the clade I, with AtMLO11 and AtMLO14. The gene is expressed during early seedling growth, in roots and lateral root primordia, in flower and fruit abscission zone, in vascular system of root, cotyledons and young leaves, it was not expressed in mature rosette leaves, as shown by GUS activity patterns. The expression of several phylogenetically closely-related AtMLO genes showed similar or overlapping tissue specificity and analogous responsiveness to external stimuli, suggesting functional redundancy, co-function, or antagonistic function(s).	1

In vitro, an N-terminal Myb domain enables it to interact with double-stranded telomeric repeats.Mutations in TRB1 and TRB3 enhance the lhp1 mutant phenotype. Triple mutants are more strongly affected than the respective double mutants with lhp1. TRB1 binds non-H3K27me3 target genes predominantly at the transcription start sites and its presence increases the expression of several of these targets, enriched for functions of primary metabolism. At H3K27me3 target genes, TRB1 binding is more distributed across gene bodies and at extended promoter regions, corresponding to an enrichment of putative binding sites "RMCCTAR". At these genes, TRB1 particiaptes in the repression because several direct targets are further upregulated in trb1 lhp1 double mutants as compared to lhp1 mutants.	1

Along with BOP2, BOP1 is required for nectary development and  formation of normal abscission zones.Forms homodimers and heterodimers with BOP2. Nuclear localization is required for activity which includes positive regulation of AS2 in leaves. BOP1/2 promotes floral meristem fate and determinacy in a pathway targetting APETALA1 and AGAMOUS-LIKE24. PUCHI, BOP1 and BOP2 are redundantly required for expression of LFY and AP1. BOP1 is expressed in valve margin. Misexpression in stems causes short internodes and ectopic biosynthesis of lignin. BOP1 activity is antagonistic to BP (At4g08150) and PNY (At5g02030). BOP1 expression is restricted to pedicel axils by BP and PNY. BOP1 promotes KNAT6 (At1g23380) expression.BOP1 Interacts with BIL1/BZR1 and Inhibits BIL1/BZR1 transport into the nucleus.	3

It may preferentially demethylate H3mK9 at low-copy loci to protect them from silencing by nearby heterochromatin by preventing the spread of cytosine methylation. BONSAI (At1g73177) is hypermethylated in ibm1 mutants. ibm1 mutants have morphological defects that become apparent at the F3 generation, including small narrow leaves, arrested flower development, and faulty pollen development. These phenotypes cannot result solely from the BONSAI hypermethylation. Aberrant phenotypes in ibm1 mutants in both DNA methylation and plant development can be suppressed by mutations in the KYP H3K9 methyltransferase or the CMT3 non CG-cytosine methylase.	3

249408_at	oligonucleotide	Arabidopsis thaliana	no	AT5G40330	Encodes a MYB gene that, when overexpressed ectopically, can induce ectopic trichome formation.  It is a member of subgroup 15, together with WER and GL1.  Members of this subgroup share a conserved motif of 19 amino acids in the putative transcription activation domain at the C-terminal end.  The gene is expressed in leaves, stems, flowers, seeds and roots and quite strongly in trichomes. There is partial functional redundancy between ATMYB23 and GL1.  The two proteins are functionally equivalent with respect to the regulation of trichome initiation but not with respect to trichome branching - which is controlled by MYB23 and not GL1.	5

Immunolocalization studies in spread preparations of  wild-type meiocytes at G2/early leptotene revealed  the accumulation of numerous rather diffuse &#947;-H2AX  foci throughout the chromatin. However,  their accumulation is not contemporaneous with  that of AtSPO11-1. At 3 h post-S, no &#947;-H2AX  foci are detected. During the 3- to 5-h window when  AtSPO11-1 foci rapidly disappear, there is an  equally swift accumulation of &#947;-H2AX to a maximum  of >50 diffuse foci.

In the root, PIN4 is detected around the quiescent center and cells surrounding it, and localizes basally in provascular cells. PIN4 expression is upregulated in brassinosteroid-insensitive mutant (PMID 16141452).	2

251849_at	oligonucleotide	Arabidopsis thaliana	no	AT3G54610	Encodes a histone acetyltransferase that plays a role in the determination of the embryonic root-shoot axis.  It is also required to regulate the floral meristem activity by modulating the extent of expression of WUS and AG. In addition, it is involved in stem cuticular wax accumulation by modulating CER3 expression via H3K9/14 acetylation. In other eukaryotes, this protein is recruited to specific promoters by DNA binding transcription factors and is thought to promote transcription by acetylating the N-terminal tail of histone H3. The enzyme has indeed been shown to catalyse primarily the acetylation of H3 histone with only traces of H4 and H2A/B being acetylated. Non-acetylated H3 peptide or an H3 peptide that had been previously acetylated on K9 both serve as excellent substrates  for HAG1-catalyzed acetylation. However, prior acetylation  of H3 lysine 14 blocks radioactive acetylation of the  peptide by HAG1.  HAG1 is specific for  histone H3 lysine 14.	3

Transcription is upregulated by abscisic acid, suggesting a role in ABA signaling.  Also functions in non-host resistance against barley powdery mildew. It is a nonessential component of the preinvasive resistance against Colletotrichum fungus. Required for mlo resistance. The syp121 point mutation results in stomatal phenotypes that reduce CO2 assimilation, slow vegetative growth and increase water use efficiency in the whole plant, conditional upon high light intensities and low relative humidity. The R20R21 motif of SYP121 are essential for SEC11 interaction. Mutation of the R20R21 motif blocks vesicle traffic without uncoupling the effects of SYP121 on solute and K+ uptake associated with the F9xRF motif; the mutation also mimicks the effects on traffic block observed on coexpression of the dominant negative SEC11?149 fragment.	3

266673_at	oligonucleotide	Arabidopsis thaliana	no	AT2G29630	Encodes a protein involved in thiamin biosynthesis. The protein is an iron-sulfur cluster protein predicted to catalyze the conversion of 5-aminoimidazole ribonucleotide (AIR) to hydroxymethylpyrimidine (HMP) or  hydroxymethylpyrimidine phosphate (HMP-P). A severe reduction of THIC levels in plants decreases vitamin B1 (thiamin diphosphate (TPP)) levels and also leads to changes in the levels of numerous other metabolites since so many primary metabolic enzymes require a TPP co-factor. thiC mutants are chlorotic and arrest in their development at the cotyledon stage. A N-terminal targeting sequence directs the THIC protein to the chloroplast stroma. A conserved TPP-binding site is located in the 3' UTR of the At2g29630.2 gene model, and is predicted to function as a riboswitch. The riboswitch controls the  formation of transcripts with alternative 3' UTR lengths, which affect mRNA accumulation and protein production. THIC transcripts are observed in seedlings 5 or more days after germination, and light promotes the expression of this gene.  Recessive mutant isolated by Redei. Leaves but not cotyledons white, lethal; restored to normal by thiamine or 2,5-dimethyl-4-aminopyrimidine.	2

And several UPR genes are transcriptionally upregulated when an N-terminal portion of the bZIP28 protein is expressed using the 35S promoter. A myc:bZIP28 fusion protein appears to be cleaved, likely at a canonical S2 cleavage site, following a TM treatment or a DTT stress-inducing treatment, but not a salt treatment. A portion of the  mGFP:bZIP28 protein present in root cells appears to translocate from the cytoplasm and ER to the nucleus following TM treatment. It is cleaved by S2P to allow translocation to the nucleus. The mRNA is cell-to-cell mobile.	3

267519_at	oligonucleotide	Arabidopsis thaliana	no	AT2G30470	HSI2 is a member of the ABI3 family of B3 domain proteins and functions as an active repressor of the Spo minimal promoter through the EAR motif. It contains a plant-specific B3 DNA-binding domain. It is expressed at similar levels in all organs. Treatment with 6% sucrose showed a slight increase in transcript levels after 24 h. No changes were observed after treatment with 50?M ABA. It is localized in the nucleus via a nuclear localization sequence located in the fourth conserved region of the C-terminal B3 domain. HSI2 is also an epigenetic repressor as it also contains functional plant homeodomain-like (PHD-L) and zinc-finger Cys- and Trp-containing (CW) domains associated with epigenetic regulation. The PHD-L domain of HSI2 is connected to promoting trimethylation of Lys-27 on histone 3 (H3K27me3), while the CW domain can bind directly to H3K4me3. Through these domains, HSI2 represses the seed maturation program during seed germination by repressing transcription of the core LAFL (LEC1, ABI3, FUS3, and LEC2) seed developmental transcriptional regulators. In developing A. thaliana embryos, HSI2 suppresses expression of a large number of genes, many identified as targets of FUS3. However, the absence of HSI2 had no effect on transcript levels of the LAFL regulators and the levels of measured metabolites and phytohormones (ABA, auxin, and JA derivatives) in developing Arabidopsis embryos. HSI2 likely fine-tunes seed maturation by repressing genes involved in early embryogenesis that are not required later for seed maturation and desiccation.	2

The gene is expressed during early seedling growth, in root tips and flower (papillae, anthers and pollen grains), as shown by GUS activity patterns.

The activity of this enzyme with a number of substrates, including acrolein and 3-buten-2-one, was demonstrated in vitro using a truncated form of the protein that lacked approximately 80 of the first amino acids. This protein appears to localize to the chloroplast where it likely helps to maintain the photosynthetic process by detoxifying reactive carbonyls formed during lipid peroxidation.	1

However, it shows some minor endochitinase activity in vitro, as well. A putative 24 amino-acid signal peptide may direct this protein to the secretory system and it has been detected in cell wall apoplastic fluid. RT-PCR experiments demonstrate that ChiC transcript levels are increased in response to abscisisc acid, jasmonic acid, and NaCl stress.

Loss of function severely affects organ initiation, pin1 mutants are characterised by an inflorescence meristem that does not initiate any flowers, resulting in the formation of a naked inflorescence stem.  PIN1 is involved in the determination of leaf shape by actively promoting development of leaf margin serrations.  In roots, the protein mainly resides at the basal end of the vascular cells, but weak signals can be detected in the epidermis and the cortex.  Expression levels and polarity of this auxin efflux carrier change during primordium development suggesting that cycles of auxin build-up and depletion accompany, and may direct, different stages of primordium development. PIN1 action on plant development does not strictly require function of PGP1 and PGP19 proteins.	1

260364_at	oligonucleotide	Arabidopsis thaliana	no	AT1G70560	TAA1 is involved in the shade-induced production of indole-3-pyruvate (IPA), a precursor to IAA, a biologically active auxin. It is also involved in regulating many aspects of plant growth and development from embryogenesis to flower formation and plays a role in ethylene-mediated signaling. This enzyme can catalyze the formation of IPA from L-tryptophan. Though L-Trp is expected to be the preferred substrate in vivo, TAA1 also acts as an aminotransferase using L-Phe, L-Tyr, L-Leu, L-Ala, L-Met, and L-Gln. Lines carrying mutations in this gene are unaffected by auxin transporter inhibitor NPA. Double mutant analysis and exogenous auxin treatment suggest that this gene is required for auxin signaling during lateral root and root meristem development. The activity of TAA1 can be controlled by phosphorylation of residue T101, which, when phosphorylated results in loss of activity. TAA1 is a target of TMK4.	1

The Arabidopsis genome contains 15 genes encoding MLO proteins, with localization in plasma membrane. Phylogenetic analysis revealed four clades of closely-related AtMLO genes. ATMLO2 belongs to the clade IV, with AtMLO3, AtMLO6 and AtMLO12. The gene is expressed during early seedling growth, in roots, in vascular system of cotyledons and young leaves,and in fruit abscission zone; it was not expressed in anthers and pollen, as shown by GUS activity patterns. The expression of several phylogenetically closely-related AtMLO genes showed similar or overlapping tissue specificity and analogous responsiveness to external stimuli, suggesting functional redundancy, co-function, or antagonistic function(s). mlo resistance in A. thaliana does not involve the signaling molecules ethylene, jasmonic acid or salicylic acid, but requires a syntaxin, glycosyl hydrolase and ABC transporter.

Sequence is similar to HAP3 subunit of the CCAAT-box binding factor. HAP3 subunit is divided into three domains: an amino-terminal A domain, a central B domain, and a carboxyl-terminal C domain. LEC1 shared high similarity with other HAP3 homologs only in central, B domain. LEC1 is required for the specification of cotyledon identity and the completion of embryo maturation. It was sufficient to induce embryogenic programs in vegetative cells, suggesting that LEC1 is a major embryonic regulator that mediates the switch between embryo and vegetative development. Mutants are desiccation intolerant, have trichomes on cotyledons and exhibit precocious meristem activation. Levels of the ABI3 and FUS3 transcripts were significantly reduced in developing siliques of the lec1-1 mutants, indicating that LEC1 down-regulates FUS3 and ABI3.When LEC1 is overexpressed from an inducible promoter, the expression of numerous genes involved in fatty acid biosynthesis is increased suggesting a role in positive regulation of FA biosynthesis. LEC is required for FLC  activation in embryos following vernalization.	1

Mutants have reduced fertility most likely as because of fusions that pistil emergence. The protein has similarity to the mandelonitrile lyase family of FAD containing oxidoreductases and is predicted to be secreted (SignalP).It is expressed in all tissue layers of roots, inflorescences, stems, leaves, and flowers and is also expressed in siliques. Expression is highest in inflorescence and flower tissue.Transmission of mutant alleles to the progeny shows non mendelian segregation- a percentage of mutant alleles revert back to a previous parental (e.g. grandparental) wild type allele. It has been suggested that an RNA template driven or other extra-DNA genomic mechanism may be responsible for the non-mendelian inheritance of HTH. Reversion events in alleles at other loci have also been observed to occur in plants with an hth mutant background indicating a genome wide effect.	1

Anthers of double mutants (bam1bam2) appeared abnormal at a very early stage and lack the endothecium, middle, and tapetum layers. Further analyses revealed that cells interior to the epidermis (in anther tissue) acquire some characteristics of pollen mother cells (PMCs), suggesting defects in cell fate specification. The pollen mother-like cells degenerate before the completion of meiosis, suggesting that these cells are defective.

250982_at	oligonucleotide	Arabidopsis thaliana	no	AT5G03150	JKD is a nuclear-localized putative transcription factor of the BIRDS/IDD C2H2 zinc finger family. JKD and its homologue BIB, restrict SHR movement to a single layer, the endodermis, and delimit tissue boundaries in the root meristem through a process that involves nuclear retention through protein complex formation. JKD mutation leads to periclinal divisions in the cortex, increased cell numbers in the circumference of the cortical and epidermal layers, a disrupted QC marker expression pattern, and disorganized QC and columella cells. This effect is enhanced in jkd bib double mutants where tissue boundaries cannot be maintained due to excessive SHR movement. JKD and BIB restrict CYCIND6 expression to cortex and endodermis stem cells to prevent formative divisions in the ground tissue.  JKD physically interacts with cell fate determinants SCR and SHR in a cell type specific manner. Native FRET-FLIM analysis showed higher JKD-SCR complex in the endodermis and predominant JKD-SHR in the QC and cortex/endodermis stem cells. In addition, JKD, SCR and SHR form a ternary complex whose conformation is cell type dependent, conformational changes of this complex differentially regulate SCR and WOX5 expression to specify endodermal cell fate and QC function respectively. Its mRNA is cell-to-cell mobile.	5

Arabidopsis ATRX mutant alleles are viable, but with reduced fertility. Their combination with mutants for the H3.3 chaperone HIRA impairs plant survival. ATRX loss affects cellular histone H3.3 pools and modulates the H3.1/H3.3 balance. Notably, at a genome-wide scale, loss of ATRX leads to a reduced H3.3 level at genes characterized by elevated H3.3 occupancy and high expression, including the 45S ribosomal DNA (45S rDNA) loci. Indeed, expression of specific 45S rDNA sequence variants is altered by ATRX loss (DOI:10.1105/tpc.16.00877)	1

Ran GTPase plays essential roles in multiple cellular processes, including nucleocytoplasmic transport, spindle formation, and postmitotic nuclear envelope reassembly. The cytoplasmic Ran GTPase activating protein RanGAP is critical to establish a functional RanGTP/RanGDP gradient across the nuclear envelope and is associated with the outer surface of the nuclear envelope in metazoan and higher plant cells. Arabidopsis thaliana RanGAP association with the root tip nuclear envelope requires a family of likely plant-specific nucleoporins combining coiled-coil and transmembrane domains (CC-TMD) and WPP domain-interacting proteins (WIPs).  WIT1 and WIT2 have been identified as a second family of CC-TMD proteins, structurally similar, yet clearly distinct from the WIP family, that is required for RanGAP nuclear envelop association in root tip cells.	5

245126_at	oligonucleotide	Arabidopsis thaliana	no	AT2G47460	"MYB12 belongs to subgroup 7 of the R2R3-MYB family. It strongly activates the promoters of chalcone synthase (CHS), flavanone 3-hydroxylase (F3H), flavonol synthase (FLS) and - to a lesser extent - chalcone flavanone isomerase (CHI), but cannot activate the promoters of flavonoid-3'hydroxylase (F3'H) and dihydroflavonol 4-reductase (DF). The activation requires a functional MYB recognition element (MRE). Results from the myb12-1f allele indicate that an activation domain might be present in the C-terminus. Overexpression or knock-out plants do not show any obvious phenotype under greenhouse conditions. Young myb12-ko seedlings contain reduced amounts of flavonoids (quercetin and kaempferol), while seedlings as well as leaves of MYB12-OX plants displayed an increased flavonoid content. They did not show any significant difference in anthocyanin content. Expression of CHS and FLS shows a clear correlation to MYB12 expression levels. CHI and F3H show increased transcript levels in the MYB12-OX lines, but no differences in the knock-out. Even in the absence of functional MYB12, flavonol biosynthesis is not completely absent, suggesting functional redundancy. " The redundant factors are MYB11 and MYB111 although MYB12 is primarily required for flavonol biosynthesis in roots. Mutations in MYB12 block both auxin and ethylene stimulation of flavonoid synthesis.	2

264188_at	oligonucleotide	Arabidopsis thaliana	no	AT1G54690	Encodes HTA3, a histone H2A protein. H2AX is a meiosis-specific isoform of histone H2A.  Upon DSB formation, rapid accumulation of phosphorylated  H2AX (&#947;-H2AX) occurs around the break site. H2AX foci accumulate in early G2.  Immunolocalization studies in spread preparations of  wild-type meiocytes at G2/early leptotene revealed  the accumulation of numerous rather diffuse &#947;-H2AX  foci throughout the chromatin. However,  their accumulation is not contemporaneous with  that of AtSPO11-1. At 3 h post-S, no &#947;-H2AX  foci are detected. During the 3- to 5-h window when  AtSPO11-1 foci rapidly disappear, there is an  equally swift accumulation of &#947;-H2AX to a maximum  of >50 diffuse foci. The level of &#947;H2AX then remains  constant for a further 13 h before undergoing a  gradual decrease to 10?20 foci in the 18- to 24-h post-S  period. By 30 h the foci have disappeared from the chromatin.	1

Subcellular localization of GFP-tagged SAD2 showed a predominantly nuclear localization, consistent with a role for SAD2 in nuclear transport.  Mutation of SAD2 in Arabidopsis alters abscisic acid sensitivity.  SAD2 was ubiquitously expressed at low levels in all tissues except flowers.  SAD2 expression was not induced by ABA or stress. Loss of function mutations in SAD2 exhibit increased tolerance for UV stress,  increased production of UV protective secondary metabolites and suppression of nuclear localization of MYB4 (a repressor of UV stress response genes). Regulates microRNA activity.	2

247821_at	oligonucleotide	Arabidopsis thaliana	no	AT5G58230	Encodes a WD-40 repeat containing protein that functions in chromatin assembly as part of the CAF1 and FIE complex. Mutants exhibit parthenogenetic development that includes proliferation of unfertilized endosperm and embryos. In heterozygous plants 50% of embryos abort. Of the aborted embryos the early aborted class are homozygous and the later aborting lass are heterozygotes in which the defective allele is maternally transmitted. Other phenotypes include defects in ovule morphogenesis and organ initiation,as well as increased levels of heterochromatic DNA. MSI1 is needed for the transition to flowering. In Arabidopsis, the three CAF-1 subunits are encoded by FAS1, FAS2 and, most likely, MSI1, respectively. Mutations in FAS1 or FAS2 lead to increased frequency of homologous recombination and T-DNA integration in Arabidopsis. In the ovule, the MSI1 transcripts are accumulated at their highest level before fertilization and gradually decrease after fertilization. MSI is biallelically expressed, the paternall allele is expressed in the endosperm and embryo and is not imprinted. MSI1 forms a complex with RBR1 that is required for activation of the imprinted genes FIS2 and FWA. This activation is mediated by MSI1/RBR1 mediated repression of MET1.	5

Consists of a single exon and is characterized by a conserved C-terminal motif and N-terminal signal peptide.  RALF23 is significantly downregulated by brassinolide treatment of seedlings.   Overexpression of AtRALF23 impairs brassinolide-induced hypocotyls elongation, and mature overexpressing plants are shorter and bushier. RALF23 overexpression produces slower growing seedlings with roots that have reduced capacity to acidify the rhizosphere.	3

264900_at	oligonucleotide	Arabidopsis thaliana	no	AT1G23080	Encodes a novel component of auxin efflux that is located  apically in the basal cell and is involved during embryogenesis in setting up the apical-basal axis in the embryo.  It is also involved in pattern specification during root development.  In roots, it is expressed at lateral and basal membranes of provascular cells in the meristem and elongation zone, whereas in the columella cells it coincides with the PIN3 domain. Plasma membrane-localized PIN proteins mediate a saturable efflux of auxin. PINs mediate auxin efflux from mammalian and yeast cells without needing additional plant-specific factors. The action of PINs in auxin efflux is distinct from PGPs, rate-limiting, specific  to auxins and sensitive to auxin transport inhibitors. PINs are directly involved of in catalyzing  cellular auxin efflux.	1

Overexpression of QQS in Arabidopsis increases protein content and decreases total starch content. Thus it appears to function to modulate carbon/nitrogen allocation in Arabidopsis. Over expression of QQS in soybean, rice and maize also results in an increase in protein and decrease in starch levels suggesting that QQS affects similar pathways in a wide range of plants. QQS interacts with NF-YC4 in Arabidopsis and NF-YC4 homologs in rice, soybean and maize. In Arabidopsis QQS is localized the the cytoplasm and when complexed with NF-YC4 , it localizes to the nucleus. Putative OXS2-binding DEGs were constitutively activated by OXS2.	3

In the root, the protein localizes apically in epidermal and lateral root cap cells and predominantly basally in cortical cells. Functions may be regulated by phosphorylation status. EIR1 expression is induced by brassinolide treatment in the brassinosteroid-insensitive br1 mutant. Gravistimulation results in asymmetric PIN2 distribution, with more protein degraded at the upper side of the gravistimulated root. Membrane sterol composition is essential for the acquisition of  PIN2 polarity. Its expression is downregulated at hypoxic conditions. RAP2.12 overexpression inhibits this downregulation.	5

265624_at	oligonucleotide	Arabidopsis thaliana	no	AT2G27250	One of the three CLAVATA genes controlling the size of the shoot apical meristem (SAM) in Arabidopsis.  Belongs to a large gene family called CLE for CLAVATA3/ESR-related.  Encodes a stem cell-specific protein CLV3 presumed to be a precursor of a secreted peptide hormone.  The deduced ORF encodes a 96-amino acid protein with an 18-amino acid N-terminal signal peptide.  The functional form of CLV3 (MCLV3) was first reported to be a posttranscriptionally modified 12-amino acid peptide, in which two of the three prolines were modified to hydroxyproline (Ito et al., Science 2006, 313:842; Kondo et al., Science 2006, 313:845).  Ohyama et al. (2009) later reported that the active mature CLV3 is a 13-amino-acid arabinosylated glycopeptide (Nature Chemical Biology, 5:578).  CLV3 binds the ectodomain of the CLAVATA1 (CLV1) receptor-kinase. Regulates shoot and floral meristem development. Required for CLAVATA1 receptor-like kinase assembly into a signaling complex that includes KAPP and a Rho-related protein.  It restricts its own domain of expression, the central zone (CZ) of the shoot apical meristem (SAM), by preventing differentiation of peripheral zone cells, which surround the CZ, into CZ cells and restricts overall SAM size by a separate, long-range effect on cell division rate. CLE domain of CLV3 is sufficient for function. Results obtained from whole seedlings challenge the concept that the immune receptor FLS2 perceives the meristematic regulatory peptide CLV3p in mesophyll, seedlings, and SAM cells and that CLV3p contributes to SAM immunity against bacterial infection (PMID:22923673).	2

It has a broad expression pattern and is involved in vascular strand development in the leaf, control of leaf shape, size and symmetry, male gametophyte development and ovule specification and function. Anthers of double mutants (bam1bam2) appeared abnormal at a very early stage and lack the endothecium, middle, and tapetum layers. Further analyses revealed that cells interior to the epidermis (in anther tissue) acquire some characteristics of pollen mother cells (PMCs), suggesting defects in cell fate specification. The pollen mother-like cells degenerate before the completion of meiosis, suggesting that these cells are defective. In addition, the BAM2 expression pattern supports both an early role in promoting somatic cell fates and a subsequent function in the PMCs. The mRNA is cell-to-cell mobile.	3

SNAREs have been divided into four subgroups: Qa-, Qb-, Qc- and R-SNAREs. R-SNAREs are classified into three groups, the Sec22-, YKT6- and VAMP7-like R-SNAREs. One R-SNARE and three Q-SNAREs (one of each subgroup) form the trans-SNARE complex, which governs specific membrane fusions.  VAMP7 proteins consist of three distinct domain, the N-terminal longin-domain (LD), the SNARE motif (SNM) and a transmembrane domain. In spite of the high similarities among the VAMP7 proteins, they show different subcellular localizations. VAMP7C is vacuolar-localized and its LD is essential for the correct localization. Generally, it is suggested that the complete LD is the determinant of subcellular sorting in both animal and plant R-SNAREs.	4

252890_at	oligonucleotide	Arabidopsis thaliana	no	AT4G39400	Encodes a plasma membrane localized leucine-rich repeat receptor kinase involved in brassinosteroid signal transduction. BRI1 ligand is brassinolide which binds at the extracellular domain. Binding results in phosphorylation of the kinase domain which activates the BRI1 protein leading to BR responses. Residue T-1049 and either S-1044 or T-1045 were essential for kinase function in vitro and normal BRI1 signaling in planta. The structure of BRI1 ligand-binding domain has been determined at 2.5A resolution.  Although BAK1 and BRI1 alone localize in the plasma membrane, when BAK1 and BRI1 are coexpressed, the heterodimer BAK1/BRI1 they form is localized in the endosome. BRI1 appears to be involved in the autonomous pathway that regulates the transition to flowering, primarily through its effects on FLC expression levels, as uncovered by double mutant analyses. This most likely occurs as a result of BRI1-dependent effects on histone acetylation, but not histone triMeH3K4 methylation, at the FLC locus. The mRNA is cell-to-cell mobile.	4

Positive regulator of the flowering-time gene CONSTANS. This gene possesses a light-induced CNT2 N-terminal homodimerisation domain.Involved in blue-light induced stomatal opening. Involved in triggering chromatin decondensation. An 80-residue motif (NC80) is sufficient to confer CRY2's physiological function.  It is proposed that the PHR domain and the C-terminal tail of the unphosphorylated CRY2 form a "closed" conformation to suppress the NC80 motif in the absence of light. In response to blue light, the C-terminal tail of CRY2 is phosphorylated and electrostatically repelled from the surface of the PHR domain to form an "open" conformation, resulting in derepression of the NC80 motif and signal transduction to trigger photomorphogenic responses. Cry2 phosphorylation and degradation both occur in the nucleus.The life-time of cry2 signaling state in situ (in planta) is about 16 min.	1

Full length ABI3 protein binds to the highly conserved RY motif [DNA motif CATGCA(TG)], present in many seed-specific promoters, and the B3 domains of this transcription factor is necessary for the specific interaction with the RY element. Transcriptional activity of ABI3 requires the B3 DNA-binding domain and an activation domain. In addition to the known N-terminal-located activation domain, a second transcription activation domain was found in the B1 region of ABI3. ABI3 is essential for seed maturation. Regulator of the transition between embryo maturation and early seedling development. Putative seed-specific transcriptional activator. ABI3 is a central regulator in ABA signaling and is unstable in vivo.  It interacts with and can by polyubiquitinated by AIP2 in vivo. Based on double mutant analyses, ABI3 interacts genetically with both FUS3 and LEC1 and is involved in controlling accumulation of chlorophyll and anthocyanins, sensitivity to abscisic acid, and expression of the members of the 12S storage protein gene family. In addition, both FUS3 and LEC1 regulate positively the abundance of the ABI3 protein in the seed.  Alternative splicing of ABI3 is developmentally regulated by SUA (AT3G54230).	3

Light reduces this activity in a phy-dependent manner.  The protein preferentially interacts with the Pfr forms of Phytochrome A (PhyA) and Phytochrome B (PhyB), is physically associated with APRR1/TOC1 and is degraded in red (R) and far-red (FR) light through the ubiquitin (ub)-26S proteasome pathway to optimize photomorphogenic development in Arabidopsis.

As 6-deoxo-CS was unable to restore the phenotype of rot3-1, it has been postulated that ROT3 might be specifically involved in the conversion of TY to CS in the C6-oxidation pathway of brassinolide. Recently, CYP90C1 was shown to catalyse the C-23 hydroxylation of several brassinosteroids (the enzyme has a broad specificity for 22-hydroxylated substrates).	4

The ETTIN gene encodes a protein with homology to DNA binding proteins which bind to auxin response elements. ETT transcript is expressed throughout stage 1 floral meristems and subsequently resolves to a complex pattern within petal, stamen and carpel primordia.  ETT probably functions to impart regional identity in floral meristems that affects perianth organ number spacing, stamen formation, and regional differentiation in stamens and the gynoecium. During stage 5, ETT expression appears in a ring at the top  of the floral meristem before morphological appearance of the gynoecium, consistent with the proposal that ETT is involved in prepatterning apical and basal boundaries in the gynoecium primordium.  It is a target of the ta-siRNA tasiR-ARF. ETT is also a target of AP2; integrateing the functions of AGAMOUS and APETALA2 in floral meristem determinacy.

Acts as an inhibitor of flowering specifically involved in the autonomous promotion pathway. EFS also regulates the expression of genes involved in carotenoid biosynthesis and nitrogen assimilation.Modification of histone methylation at the CRTISO locus reduces transcript levels 90%. The increased shoot branching seen in some EFS mutants is likely due to the carotenoid biosynthesis defect having an effect on stringolactones.Required for ovule, embryo sac, anther and pollen development.	1
245444_at	oligonucleotide	Arabidopsis thaliana	no	AT4G16740	Encodes an (E,E)-alpha-farnesene synthase in the Col ecotype of Arabidopsis.

Eight types of APX have been described for Arabidopsis: three cytosolic (APX1, APX2, APX6), two chloroplastic types (stromal sAPX, thylakoid tAPX), and three microsomal (APX3, APX4, APX5) isoforms. At least part of the induction of heat shock proteins during light stress in Arabidopsis is mediated by H2O2 that is scavenged by APX1. Expression of the gene is downregulated in the presence of paraquat, an inducer of photoxidative stress. The mRNA is cell-to-cell mobile.	1
